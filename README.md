# Titan (MY OWN PROGRAMMING INTERPRETER/LANGUAGE) (.ti)
So i created titan with the aim to help non technical users code their day to day task and automate their day to day tasks.
Titan(.ti) is developed on python and based on BASIC.
Everything is hardcoded and no dynamic processing take place.
Let's not talk about the time and space complexicity (will take care of this when we complete our control flow).
Till now it can print, assign values, input, can do arthemitc operations and have control flow (only IF).
As i am on a limited timeframe. i will be progressing with the language in future. (Update: added the control flow).
